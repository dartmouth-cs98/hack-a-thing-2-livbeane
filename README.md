We built a chrome extension that will provide the user with directions to a location or information about that location, based on an image. This extension utilizes the cloud vision api to identify landmarks based on images. 
The user right clicks on an image, and a context menu appears with a label that says "take me there". The user then has two options, either to get the information about the location from wikipedia, or directions from google maps. If the google vision api does not recognize the location, then a popup banner appears letting the user know that the location can't be found based on the image provided.
